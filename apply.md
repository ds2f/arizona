# Call for proposals

_Note_: This site has been superseded by [https://new.library.arizona.edu/ds2f](https://new.library.arizona.edu/ds2f).

## Summary
This fellowship program is designed to address three known challenges in contemporary higher education:

+ Insufficient technical training for digital or data-intensive research within subject disciplines;
+ Uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and
+ A need for ongoing development of modular curricula for emerging technology that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops, or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

## Eligibility
Graduate students at the University of Arizona who are enrolled full time in both Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 in any college or discipline.

## Time commitment
The program runs January 2020 through December 2020 and includes weekly meetings on Friday afternoons while classes are in session as well as self-directed learning time, with an estimated commitment of approximately 4 hours per week.

## Stipend
$1,500 total, disbursed in two installments.

## Deliverables
A public workshop in Fall 2020 and accompanying curricular materials that are made openly available online. Fellows can choose from the following Creative Commons licenses/marks so that their curricular materials can be reused and adapted by others: [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0).

## How to apply
Applications are due **October 15, 2019** (by 11:59 pm local Arizona time).

Please submit the following materials to [https://tinyurl.com/ua-ds2f](https://tinyurl.com/ua-ds2f):

+ A statement of intent, in 2 pages or less, that addresses
    1. the technical skill that you would like to pursue through self-directed learning as a member of the cohort,
    2. how this skill applies to your research trajectory,
    3. your interest and willingness to design and deliver public workshops that are open to the UA community, and
    4. what diverse perspectives or representation you would contribute to the cohort.
+ A current C.V.
+ Contact information for two references, at least one in your academic program

## Application evaluation
All applicants will be notified by November 30, 2019. Selected applicants may be contacted for 20-minute Zoom interviews during the review period. Applicants will be selected based on the strength of their individual statements with preference given to enhancing the overall diversity of the cohort and interest in fellowship projects whose outcomes will serve the needs of the broader University of Arizona community.

## Sample projects
We welcome applications that address any aspect of digital scholarship or data science, including projects focused on tools, methods, or techniques. Some potential areas for exploration could include:

+ Web scraping, text data mining, natural language processing
+ Digital publishing platforms (e.g. Omeka, Scalar), electronic notebooks, digital project management
+ Data visualization, 3-D modeling
+ Data cleaning, data analysis
+ Network analysis, neural networks, machine learning

Note this is _not_ an exhaustive list, but just some examples of the areas which may have broad appeal to the campus audience.
