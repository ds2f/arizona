The University of Arizona Libraries are seeking an inaugural cohort of graduate student fellows interested in building skills in digital scholarship or data science and willing to share their knowledge back to the University of Arizona community through workshops and online training materials. We encourage applications from students at any phase of their graduate studies who have identified a technical gap in their formal coursework and training that requires self-directed learning. We are committed to fostering a cohort of graduate student fellows drawn from a broad range of disciplines and domains represented on campus.

The Digital Scholarship & Data Science Fellowship program (DS<sup>2</sup>F) is designed to cross academic years, beginning in January 2020 and running through December 2020. During the spring semester, fellows will engage in a scaffolded process of entrepreneurial inquiry while also participating in a series of librarian-led workshops focused on instructional design, digital pedagogy, and open educational resources. In the fall semester, fellows transition from learners to instructors as they prepare public workshops on their chosen topic. Fellows will also create online tutorials that will be included in an open access repository of training materials for data-intensive, computational research.
